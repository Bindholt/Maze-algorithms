# Labyrinth
This project involves creating and solving a maze using two different algorithms.

## Maze Building
The maze is built using a **recursive backtracking** algorithm. 

## Maze Solving
To solve the maze, a **Breadth-First Search** (BFS) algorithm is used. 

## How to Run
Use live server to run the maze.html file.
Add rows and cols to the inputs and press generate to create a maze.
Press solve to solve the maze.
